These files were used to generate a nations.csv.  Nations.csv contains nations,
their code, GDP, life expectancy and overall literacy rate.  I generated these files
from Wikipedia near the end of 2014.  I am including the four Wikipedia source files,
and the Python generation script.

I created this data set as example input for machine learning algorithms in my book
series Artificial Intelligence for Humans.  The numbers are as accurate as the numbers
from Wikipedia.  This data is only meant to be used for machine learning examples and
not for any sort of sociology, economic or other analysis.
